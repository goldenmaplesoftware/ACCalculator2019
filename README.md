This is a calculator written in the C language that is supposed to emulate some basic AC calculations.  
Originally written in spring of 2019,   this is a pretty basic program that you can do some manual inputs.
All should run in the terminal shell without much hassle. 

The source code was compiled and tested on Visual Studio 2017 and recompiled and tested in Visual Studio 2019;  
hence why the scan functions and certain features differtiate.  
This will NOT work on Codeblocks IDE.
